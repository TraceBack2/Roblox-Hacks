# Roblox-Hacks
Undetected overpowered roblox cheats that will not get you banned and crash game/player cheats.

# How do I use this
on the main page at https://github.com/TraceBack2/Roblox-Hacks click "Code" and download Zip, you may get a anti virus warning saying its malitious but it is not, it says that because of the update checker that checks our discord if it has an update and also because it interacts with roblox without being actually in robloxs files. Dont worry its not malware. If it does not let you get the files, just make an exception for the files then go to the zip and extract it, you will then see the file called "Main.exe", you will open this (If you have any issues it would in some cases work better if ran as admin but not required) and it will open a window on your screen and you will be able to choose which things you want on roblox and it will load them directly to roblox without moving files everywhere and it updates by itself. If there is any problems or suggestions for this then put them in the issues tab.

# Is this malware
No, it is not, it is a false detection because it checks for updates and because it looks for your roblox and edits its scripts to add the cheats.

# How do I suggest something
Put them in the issues tab and ill read them

# Will I get banned
No, there is a 0% chance you will be banned because of the unique methods that was used to create and load the cheats

# My PC thinks this is malware and I cant laod the cheats
go to your anti virus and go to the things it blocked and find a allow on device or create exception option then you should be able to load the cheats


# This executer is safe and undetected and overpowered.
